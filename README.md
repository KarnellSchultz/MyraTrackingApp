### Why is it called Myra Tracking App? 
Myra is Swedish for ant.  Ants are kind of bugs so it's kinda of a "Bug Tracking App". 

### What can I do with this app? 
it's desigend to be a light weight browser based app to track the progress of work or goals. Ideally you'd start with a task 'to-do', then you'd set it to 'in progress' while you're working on it. Finally when it's done you'd change the status to 'Done'. 

### Why do I need to login to Myra App? 
Login is required so that the tasks you create are only seen by you. This is also to make sure everyone has their own list of tasks that persist over time. 

### What next for Myra? 
I'll continue to add features to Myra. Those features include sorting, tags, ect... That said, i'm open to feedback. 
Adding drag and drop features. List sorting drag and drop features
